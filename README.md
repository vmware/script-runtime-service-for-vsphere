# Script Runtime Service for vSphere (SRS)

## Overview

Script Runtime Service for vSphere (SRS) enables vSphere users and services (clients) to manage PowerCLI instances and run PowerCLI scripts. SRS clients authenticate once with vSphere creadentials or access token. SRS clients are able to create PowerCLI instances and run scripts within. PowerCLI runs server-side and automatically connects to target vSphere servers. SRS tracks history of script ouputs.

### Highlights
* Central place with REST API endpoint for VI Admins in an organization to run [VMware PowerCLI](https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/12.1.0/vmware-powercli)
* Run PowerCLI without having it installed on local machine
* Manage multiple PowerCLI instances and run commands and scripts within against vSphere infrastructure without calling Connect-VIServer
* Runs on Kubernetes

## Build & Run
Script Runtime Service is a kubernetes application but since it is vSphere add-on service you can build and package it in a Photon OS OVF virtual machine from source code. OVF has custom properties that take care to register SRS to desired vCenter Server on first boot. Thus, you can have SRS deployed and configured with simple ovf deploy.

### Prerequisites

* MacOS or Linux Desktop
* vCenter Server or Standalone ESXi host 6.x or greater
* [dotnet sdk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [PowerShell 7.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7)
* [VMware PowerCLI](https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/12.1.0/vmware-powercli)
* [VMware OVFTool](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/)
* [Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/install)


### How to build and run SRS

> `packer` builds the OVF on a remote ESXi host via the [`vmware-iso`](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/vmware-iso.html) builder. This builder requires the SSH service running on the ESXi host, as well as `GuestIPHack` enabled via the command below.
```bash
esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
```

1. Edit the `photon-builder.json` file to configure the vSphere endpoint for building the SRS appliance

```json
{
  "builder_host": "192.168.30.10",
  "builder_host_username": "root",
  "builder_host_password": "VMware1!",
  "builder_host_datastore": "vsanDatastore",
  "builder_host_portgroup": "VM Network"
}
```

**Note:** If you need to change the initial root password on the SRS appliance, take a look at `photon-version.json` and `http/photon-kickstart.json`. When the OVF is produced, there is no default password, so this does not really matter other than for debugging purposes.

2. Start the build by running the [build.sh script](https://github.com/vmware/script-runtime-service-for-vsphere/blob/master/build.sh)  which builds Script Runtime Service containers and then calls `packer` and the respective build files

```
./build.sh <PowerCLI Modules path>
````

3. Deploy SRS from OVF on vSphere with [deploy.ps1](https://github.com/vmware/script-runtime-service-for-vsphere/blob/master/appliance/deploy.ps1) PowerShell script which basically edits the OvfConfig settings by given parameters and deploys a VM from the OVA.

4. Test SRS API is available on `https://<SRS VM IP>/swagger`

## Documentation

## SRS API
API definition is available on `https://<SRS Address>/swagger`<br/>

### 1 Authetication
SRS uses VC SSO as Identity and Authentication Server. Two types of authentication are supported. SIGN and Basic. SIGN authentication is purposed for service to service access to SRS resources. For convenience of the end-users SRS supports basic authentication passing username and password which are used only to acquire HoK Saml token for SRS solution. When basic is used SRS uses usename and password to present them to SSO server and exchange them for SAML token. SES uses the SAML token to Connect PowerCLI to VC services in further operations. <br/>
On successful authentication SRS issues its own Authorization token which MUST be used to authorize further SRS API calls.<br />

`POST https://<SES IP>/api/auth/login`

Example basic authentication request:<br/>
```bash
curl -X POST "https://10.23.81.245/api/auth/login" -H "accept: \*/\*" -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvckB2c3BoZXJlLmxvY2FsOkFkbWluITIz"
```

`Response:`
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
date: Wed, 03 Jun 2020 11:49:50 GMT
server: nginx/1.17.10
status: 200
strict-transport-security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains
x-srs-api-key: b3133982-93ea-4f92-ba03-2e122c1e0fd8
```

`x-srs-api-key` header contains the issued authorization token it shold be used for futher SES API calls<br/>

### 2 Create Runspace (PowerShell instance running in SRS)

`POST https://<SRS IP>/api/runspaces`

`Example:`
```bash
curl -X POST "https://10.23.81.245/api/runspaces" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-SRS-API-KEY: b3133982-93ea-4f92-ba03-2e122c1e0fd8" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"MyRunspace\",\"run_vc_connection_script\":true}"
```
